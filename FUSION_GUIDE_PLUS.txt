1.1 How to read fusion rules
============================

This FAQ contains all 50242 fusions in the game. Rather than listing them
individually, we take the same approach as DBirtolo and Kingtut1's fusion FAQ 
and abstract sets of fusions into general rules. The most important difference 
is we also show how to resolve conflicts between rules. Here's an example:

[Female] + [Fish]         = Ice Water (1150/900 Npt/Mon)
                            < Wow Warrior (1250/900 Npt/Mrs),
                              Tatsunootoshigo (1350/1600 Npt/Mrc)
                          = Enchanting Mermaid (1200/900 Npt/Vns)
                          = Amazon of the Seas (1300/1400 Npt/Mrs)
                            < Wow Warrior (1250/900 Npt/Mrs),
                              Tatsunootoshigo (1350/1600 Npt/Mrc),
                              Dark Witch (1800/1700 Sun/Npt),
                              Queen of Autumn Leaves (1800/1500 Jpt/Mon)

Note that each card is followed by the card's attack points, defense points and 
guardian stars between parentheses.

If we ignore cards that aren't preceded by an equals sign, the above rule states
that by combining any female card MATERIAL1 with any fish card MATERIAL2 we get
- Ice Water if both MATERIAL1 and MATERIAL2 have strictly less than 1150 attack
points,
- Enchanting Mermaid if both MATERIAL1 and MATERIAL2 have strictly less than
1200 attack points and at least one of them has at least 1150 attack points,
- Amazon of the Seas if both MATERIAL1 and MATERIAL2 have strictly less than
1300 attack points and at least one of them has at least 1200 attack points.

Each of the remaining cards takes precedence over the equals-sign-preceded card
above it:
- a pair of cards that would fuse and become Ice Water will become instead Wow
Warrior or Tatsunootoshigo if the pair satisfies a fusion rule for one of these
two cards;
- a pair of cards that would fuse and become Amazon of the Seas will become
instead Wow Warrior, Tatsunootoshigo, Dark Witch or Queen of Autumn Leaves if
the pair satisfies a fusion rule for one of these four cards. 

You might be wondering what a female card is. While some general rules can be
described with in-game card types, henceforth called primary types, like 

[Aqua] + [Thunder]        = Bolt Escargot (1400/1500 Plt/Jpt)

others require the introduction of new types of card, called secondary types.
These secondary types, including the female secondary type, are all defined in
section 6 of this guide. Note that, sometimes, you'll see set-theoretic notation
used. The only cases where this happens are 

{Clown Zombie, Crass Clown}
{Harpie Lady, Harpie Lady Sisters}
{Hibikime, Sonic Maid}
{Kappa Avenger, Psychic Kappa}

Here, for instance, {Clown Zombie, Crass Clown} denotes the set of cards formed
by Clown Zombie and Crass Clown.

=====================================================
1.2 Exceptions to the fusion rules attack requirement
=====================================================

As seen in the previous section, in order for two cards to fuse to a third,
the first two cards must have an attack level strictly below the third's.
There are exceptions to this requirement and they are
- fusion rules in which the result has 0 attack points (namely, Cocoon of 
Evolution, equip, magic, trap and ritual cards) and
- the following exact fusions:

Zanki                    + Warrior Elimination      = Armored Zombie
Battle Ox                + Dragon Statue            = Baby Dragon
Dragon Piper             + Orion the Battle King    = Baby Dragon
Monster Egg              + The Wicked Worm Beast    = Baby Dragon
Cyber Shield             + Monster Tamer            = Beautiful Beast Trainer
Crass Clown              + Final Flame              = Clown Zombie
Crawling Dragon          + Dragon Capture Jar       = Dragon Zombie
Jirai Gumo               + Metalmorph               = Launcher Spider
Koumori Dragon           + Saggi the Dark Clown     = Reaper of the Cards
Clown Zombie             + Kojikocy                 = The 13th Grave
Dream Clown              + Mysterious Puppeteer     = The 13th Grave
Ancient Jar              + Fiend Sword              = Tiger Axe
Gyakutenno Megami        + Weather Control          = Witty Phantom
Armored Zombie           + Wood Clown               = Witty Phantom

For all other fusions, both materials have strictly less attack points than the
resulting card.

===================================
1.3 How to read conflicts in detail
===================================

In section 5 of this FAQ, we list every possible pair of materials that would
fuse to a given card, but end up yielding a card that conflicts with it. For
example:

[Female]                  + [Fish] = Amazon of the Seas
[Warrior]                 + [Fish] < Wow Warrior
Princess of Tsurugi         Enchanting Mermaid
Protector of the Throne     Root Water
Queen's Double              White Dolphin
Sonic Maid                  
Vishwar Randi       

The above conflict in detail says that if Princess of Tsurugi, Protector of the
Throne, Queen's Double, Sonic Maid or Viswar Randi would fuse with either
Enchanting Mermaid, Root Water or White Dolphin to
become Amazon of the Seas because of the rule [Female] + [Fish] = Amazon of the
Seas, then the fusion will instead result in Wow Warrior because of the
conflicting rule [Warrior] + [Fish] = Wow Warrior, that takes precedence. In
fact, more can be said: even if the fusion wouldn't result in Amazon of the
Seas (like in the case of Vishwar Randi and Root Water, that would fuse to Ice
Water since they have 900 < 1150 attack points), the fusion will still result in
Wow Warrior.

===================================
1.4 Exceptional conflicts in detail
===================================

These are 2 conflicts in detail where a sibling of the conflict may be produced
by the fusion instead of the conflict itself. Two cards are siblings if they
appear preceded by an equals sign in the same fusion rule, like Ice Water,
Enchanting Mermaid and Amazon of the Seas. In those exceptional conflicts in
detail, it is indicated explictly that a sibling may be produced instead. Simply
hit Ctrl-F and type 'or sibling' and you'll see the 2 cases I mentioned.

========================
2. How this FAQ was made
========================

In his RNG manipulation tutorial on YouTube, speedrunner GFC gives a link to
GenericMadScientist's RNG Manipulation Script Dropbox folder. Alongside the
actual script, that folder provides two databases with information about
cards, fusions, drop rates and much more: FmDatabase.db and FmDatabaseWithGS.db.

When I saw those databases, I had the idea of using them to complete DBirtolo
and Kingtut1's fusion FAQ. That's what I did. Here are the steps I took:
- I created my own database compiling all data from both databases above. I used
the DB Browser for SQLite (https://sqlitebrowser.org/) and some SQL code I wrote
for that.
- I copied the fusion rules from DBirtolo and Kingtut1's fusion FAQ into a text
file called fusions.txt, making minor changes
- I used a Python script with the module sqlite3 to add all missing fusions
to fusions.txt. I was able to (manually) abstract some sets of rules into
general rules by creating new secondary types.
- I manually wrote SQL code to determine fusion conflicts and manually added
them to fusions.txt. (I later regretted not having automated this step.)
- I wrote a Python script to check that the conflict graph didn't have cycles.
The conflict graph is the graph whose vertices are the cards that can be
produced by fusions and such that there is an arc from card_B to card_A if and
only if card_A < card_B, that is, there is a fusion rule where card_B appears as
a conflict for card_A.
- I wrote a Python script that produced a topological ordering of the conflict
graph's vertices and programmatically created a big SQL file that generated a
big table with all predicted fusions according to the rules. The topological
ordering was necessary because, if card_A < card_B, then the predicted fusions
for card_B have to be generated before the predicted fusions for card_A.
- I wrote some SQL code to verify that the predicted fusions were the same
as the actual fusions in the game and saw success.
- I wrote a Python script to produce all the conflicts in detail and
verify that the materials listed would always produce the shown conflict or
some sibling.
- I wrote a Python script to produce all types and then manually edited in
high-level definitions for the types
- Finally, I wrote a Python script to produce all secondary types by card

The main improvements of this guide relative to DBirtolo and Kingtut1's are
- completeness: this guide has all fusions and also shows how to resolve
each conflict;
- programmatic validation: all the information in this guide has either been
verified or generated by a computer;
- introduction of definitions for some secondary types that don't require the
reader to memorize lists of cards:
  - Bugrothians (previously incompletely referred to as Aqua), Koumorians
  (previosly referred to as Special-Bs), Sheepians (previously incompletely
  referred to as Fiend or Zombie) and Thronians (previously not defined),
  which are now defined in terms of their primary type and first guardian star;
  - MystElfians (previously referred to as Special-Cs), MercuryMagicUsers and
  MercurySpellcasters, which are now defined in terms of their first guardian
  star and
  - MusKingians (previously incompletely described as Fairies), which are now
  defined in terms of their primary type and whether they are Elves.
